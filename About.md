Hello, my name is Mathieu Poliquin and I am the founder of CodeMeon as well as programmer and designer on AI ARCADE.
I spent over 10 years combined at Activision and Ubisoft were I worked as a programmer. Several years ago I decided to start doing research on Education with Videogames and AI
because I believe we are just barely scratching the surface of the immense positive power videogames + AI can have on the mind.
If you are a teacher or student I would love to hear feature requests and needs you have in terms of video games for Education.
