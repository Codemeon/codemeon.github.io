Hello, my name is Mathieu Poliquin and I am the founder of CodeMeon as well as programmer and designer on AI ARCADE.
I spent over 10 years combined at Activision and Ubisoft were I worked as a programmer. Several years ago I decided to start doing research on Education with Videogames
because I believe we are just barely scratching the surface of the immense positive power videogames can have on the mind.
